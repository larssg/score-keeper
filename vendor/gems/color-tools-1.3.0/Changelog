= color-tools Change Log

== color-utils 1.3.0
* Added new metallic colours suggested by Jim Freeze <jfn@freeze.org>. These
  are in the namespace Color::Metallic.
* Colours that were defined in the Color namespace (e.g., Color::Red,
  Color::AliceBlue) are now defined in Color::RGB (e.g., Color::RGB::Red,
  Color::RGB::AliceBlue). They are added back to the Color namespace on the
  first use of the old colours and a warning is printed. In version 1.4, this
  warning will be printed on every use of the old colours. In version 1.5,
  the backwards compatible support for colours like Color::Red will be
  removed completely.
* Added the Color::CSS module, color/css or Color::CSS that provides a name
  lookup of Color::RGB-namespaced constants with Color::CSS[name]. Most of
  these colours (which are mirrored from the Color::RGB default colours) are
  only "officially" recognised under the CSS3 colour module or SVG.
* Added the Color::HSL colour space and some helper utilities to Color::RGB
  for colour manipulation using the HSL value.
* Controlled internal value replacement to be between 0 and 1 for all
  colours.
* Updated Color::Palette::Gimp to more meaningfully deal with duplicate named
  colours. Named colours now return an array of colours.
* Indicated the plans for some methods and constants out to color-tools 2.0.
* Added unit tests and fixed a number of hidden bugs because of them.

== color-utils 1.2.0
* Changed installer from a custom-written install.rb to setup.rb
  3.3.1-modified.
* Added Color::GreyScale (or Color::GrayScale).
* Added Color::YIQ. This colour definition is incomplete; it does not have
  conversions from YIQ to other colour spaces.

== color-utils 1.1.0
* Added color/palette/gimp to support the reading and use of GIMP color
  palettes.

== color-utils 1.0.0
* Initial release.
