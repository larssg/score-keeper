= color-tools README
color-tools is a Ruby library to provide RGB, CMYK, and other colourspace
support to applications that require it. It also provides 152 named RGB
colours. It offers 152 named RGB colours (184 with spelling variations)
that are commonly supported and used in HTML, SVG, and X11 applications. A
technique for generating a monochromatic contrasting palette is also
included.

Version 1.3 offers significant enhancements over color-tools 1.2, and a
plan for an incompatible change to the library.

* Colours that were defined in the Color namespace (e.g., Color::Red,
  Color::AliceBlue) are now defined in Color::RGB (e.g., Color::RGB::Red,
  Color::RGB::AliceBlue). They are added back to the Color namespace on
  the first use of the old colours and a warning is printed. In version
  1.4, this warning will be printed on every use of the old colours. In
  version 1.5, the backwards compatible support for colours like
  Color::Red will be removed completely.

* A CSS colour name module has been added. It is based on the Color::RGB
  predefined colours. It is called with "Color::CSS[color]". The provided
  colour name will be looked up ignoring case so that "DarkSalmon" and
  "darksalmon" (and :darksalmon) are the same value. This makes it easier
  on web or SVG developers who wish to be able to manipulate a colour
  based on a CSS colour name.

* A new predefined colour namespace has been added for RGB metallic
  colours (Color::Metallic, in color/rgb/metallic), suggested by Jim
  Freeze <jfn@freeze.org>.

* A new colour space, Color::HSL (hue, saturation, and luminosity) has
  been added with some helper methods to Color::RGB for colour
  manipulation.

* Added unit tests and fixed various little bugs.
