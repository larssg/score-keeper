h1. yui_compressor_fu

This plugin will minify your javascripts and stylesheets using YUI Compressor. It doesn't require any configuration at all. It will simply minify everything in javascript_include_tag and stylesheet_link_tag if your rails caching stuff is on. 

h3. Installation

  %> script/plugin install git://github.com/maxim/yui_compressor_fu.git
  
YUI Compressor is a jar file, hence needs java command to work.

h3. Usage

  say "kumbaya my lord, kumbaya"


h3. Why?

I didn't like anything else. asset_packager makes me list all files, bundle_fu doesn't use yui compressor. I didn't find anything else decent. Thus, I decided to write something small, clean, and delicate, only to complement rails built-in caching and concatenation with some of the best compression out there.
